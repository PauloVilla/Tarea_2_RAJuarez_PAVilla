# Tarea_2_RAJuarez_PAVilla

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a time series analysis and forecast using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. The project will consist of the following steps:

1. Finding the best ARIMA model using the AIC, BIC, and log-likelihood criteria and justifying the proposed structure.
2. Analyzing the effect of normalizing the time series, i.e., using MinMaxScaler to normalize the data. After this, repeat the same process performed in class and find the best ARIMA model. Justify all the analysis performed, including the results of the ACF and PAC graphs.
3. Investigate the implementation and theory of SARIMAX models. In addition to that, generate a forecasting model using SARIMAX, where all the previously described procedure is implemented, for the following dataset with seasonality:

## Tools and Libraries
* Python
* pandas
* numpy
* statsmodels
* matplotlib

## Prerequisites
Before starting with the project, make sure you have the necessary libraries and tools installed.

## Steps
1. Load the data into a pandas dataframe and perform any necessary preprocessing.
2. Plot the data to visualize the trend and seasonality.
3. Normalize the data using MinMaxScaler, if necessary.
4. Plot the ACF and PAC graphs of the data to identify the lags for ARIMA modeling.
5. Use the AIC, BIC, and log-likelihood criteria to find the best ARIMA model.
6. Evaluate the performance of the ARIMA model using various metrics.
7. Investigate the implementation and theory of SARIMAX models.
8. Generate a forecasting model using SARIMAX, and evaluate its performance.
9. Draw conclusions based on the results and justify your findings.

## Conclusion
At the end of the project, we will have a better understanding of time series analysis and forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. We will also be able to compare the performance of the two models and determine the best one for a given dataset.
